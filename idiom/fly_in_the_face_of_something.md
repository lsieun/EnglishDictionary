# fly in the face of (something)

- Word: fly in the face of (something)
- Meaning: To be or act in clear conflict with or opposition to something else. The first version, from the 1550s, was to fly in a person’s face and its literal meaning was of a dog that attacked by springing at a person. Very early on, it acquired the figurative sense of verbally attacking someone who disagreed with your opinions or your actions, decidedly getting in their face.
- Chinese: 公然违抗；敢于违抗；与某事物相悖（最早的起源是，一条狗跳起来向人的脸部扑过去，引申之后的比喻含意就是“口头攻击”）
