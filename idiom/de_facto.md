# de facto

- Word: de facto
- Story: De facto is Latin for "of fact," meaning "in reality," and it's usually contrasted with "de jure," which means "of law," or "officially."
- Story: If you're the de facto mayor of your town, you’re acting as mayor, even though you weren't legally elected. You may be just helping out while the official mayor — the de jure mayor, the person who was officially elected — is out of town or ill. Or it might be more sinister(邪恶的) — you seized power from the true mayor and locked him in the basement of town hall, and now you’ve made yourself the de facto mayor.
- Meaning: existing as a fact although it may not be legally accepted as existing
- Chinese: 实际上存在的（不一定合法）
