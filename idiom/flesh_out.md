- Eg.: Java 5 includes an abstract `java.net.CookieHandler` class that defines an API for storing and retrieving cookies. However, it does not include an implementation of that abstract class, so it requires a lot of grunt work. Java 6 fleshes this out by adding a concrete `java.net.CookieManager` subclass of `CookieHandler` that you can use.
