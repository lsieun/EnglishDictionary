# Cognition

- cognition: 认知；感知；认识 the process by which knowledge and understanding is developed in the mind
- recognise: 认识；认出；辨别出 to know who sb is or what sth is when you see or hear them, because you have seen or heard them or it before

## 据我所知

- **As far as I know**, he did nothing wrong. 据我所知，他并没有做错任何事。

## 对事情的掌握是模糊的、不清楚的

- fuzzy: 糊涂的；含混不清的 confused and not expressed clearly

You’re probably **familiar with** the term "certificate", even if you’re **fuzzy** on the details. 这句话讲的很好，你对一个概念是熟悉的，虽然可能你并不了解它的细节。

- hazy: 记不清的；模糊的 not clear because of a lack of memory, understanding or detail
- haze: （尤指热天引起的）薄雾，雾霭 air that is difficult to see through because it contains very small drops of water, especially caused by hot weather

**At this point**, you may have at least a **hazy** idea of how most of the concepts of the past three chapters can be put together to establish a secure communications link: First, a symmetric algorithm and key is chosen, and then the key is exchanged using public-key techniques. Finally, everything is encrypted using the secret symmetric key and authenticated using an HMAC with another secret key. 我觉得，使用"At this time"就是没有使用"At this point"来的好，而hazy的使用却很常用，给别人一个大体思路，就可以使用hazy。haze本身表示“薄雾”，这里是使用它的引申含义。
