# terrain

Much of humankind's history can be traced by its effort to alter the terrain. We've made mountains into meadows(草地；牧场), rivers into lakes, and prairies into roads, all to make the terrain more livable for us.



- basin: 流域 an area of land around a large river with streams running down into it; 盆地；凹地；海盆a place where the earth's surface is lower than in other areas of the world


- desert: 沙漠；荒漠；荒原 a large area of land that has very little water and very few plants growing on it. Many deserts are covered by sand.
- meadow: 草地；牧场
- prairie: 北美草原；新大陆北部草原（美国北部和加拿大）a flat wide area of land in N America and Canada, without many trees and originally covered with grass
- grassland: 草原；草地；草场 a large area of open land covered with wild grass
- hayfield: (牧草)打草场
- hay: （用作饲料的）干草，草料 grass that has been cut and dried and is used as food for animals

- shore: （海洋、湖泊等大水域的）岸，滨 the land along the edge of the sea or ocean, a lake or another large area of water

The noun meadow is another word for a hayfield, but offers a much more picturesque view as an open field of lush grass filled with butterflies and birds, with room to run. It can also refer to a piece of land found along a river.

The word meadow refers to any grassland or hayfield, often just an expansive area that should be mowed. Indeed, the word comes from the Old English word mæd from the Germanic mædwon the base of which means “mow.” Still, the bucolic feeling is retained, as Dale Carnegie put it: “Let us not get so busy or live so fast that we can't listen to the music of the meadow or the symphony that glorifies the forest."
