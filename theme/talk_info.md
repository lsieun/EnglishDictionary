# talk information

这里注重信息的传递

- inform: 知会；通知；通告 to tell sb about sth, especially in an official way
- impart: 通知；透露；传授 to pass information, knowledge, etc. to other people
- impartial: 公正的；不偏不倚的；中立的 not supporting one person or group more than another (这个容易与impart混淆)

A teacher's duty is to impart knowledge to students. 教师的职责就是向学生传授知识。

## 暗示

- imply: 含有…的意思；暗示；暗指 to suggest that sth is true or that you feel or think sth, without saying so directly
- indicate: 暗示；间接提及；示意 to mention sth, especially in an indirect way

## 泄露

- divulge: 泄露，透露（秘密）to give sb information that is supposed to be secret
