# physics

- physics: 物理学 the scientific study of matter and energy and the relationships between them, including the study of forces, heat, light, sound, electricity and the structure of atoms
- physicist: 物理学家；物理学研究者 a scientist who studies physics

## 物质

- ion: 离子 an atom or a molecule with a positive or negative electric charge caused by its losing or gaining one or more electrons
- molecule: 分子 the smallest unit, consisting of a group of atoms, into which a substance can be divided without a change in its chemical nature
- atom: 原子 the smallest part of a chemical element that can take part in a chemical reaction
- nucleus: 核；原子核 the part of an atom that contains most of its mass and that carries a positive electric charge
- proton: 质子 a very small piece of matter (= a substance) with a positive electric charge that forms part of the nucleus (= central part) of an atom
- neutron: 中子 a very small piece of matter (= a substance) that carries no electric charge and that forms part of the nucleus (= central part) of an atom
- electron: 电子 a very small piece of matter (= a substance) with a negative electric charge, found in all atoms
- quark: 夸克（据信构成质子、中子等的细小粒子）a very small part of matter (= a substance). There are several types of quark and it is thought that protons, neutrons, etc. are formed from them.
- neutrino: 中微子 an extremely small particle that has no electrical charge, and which rarely reacts with other matter

- fission: （核）裂变，分裂 the act or process of splitting the nucleus (= central part) of an atom, when a large amount of energy is released

## 力

- inertia: 惯性 a property (= characteristic) of matter (= a substance) by which it stays still or, if moving, continues moving in a straight line unless it is acted on by a force outside itself
- momentum: 冲力 a force that is gained by movement

## electricity

- volt: 伏，伏特（电压单位）a unit for measuring the force of an electric current
- voltage: 电压；伏特数 electrical force measured in volts
- watt: 瓦，瓦特（电功率单位）a unit for measuring electrical power

- capacitor: 电容器 a device used to store an electrical charge
- conductivity: 电导率 the ability of an object or substance to transmit heat, electricity, or sound

- resistor: 电阻器 a device that has resistance to an electric current in a circuit
- transistor: 晶体管 a small electronic device used in computers, radios, televisions, etc. for controlling an electric current as it passes along a circuit
- semiconductor: 半导体 a solid substance that conducts electricity in particular conditions, better than insulators but not as well as conductors
- insulator: 隔热（或绝缘、隔音等的）材料（或装置）a material or device used to prevent heat, electricity, or sound from escaping from sth

## 光

- infrared: 红外线的；使用红外线的 having or using electromagnetic waves which are longer than those of red light in the spectrum , and which cannot be seen
