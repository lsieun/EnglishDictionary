- Story: Someone's disposition is their mood or general attitude about life. **Disposition** means **the positive or negative way a person views the world**. In contrast, your **character** is determined by your **inner moral values**, and your **personality** reflects **what you're like as an individual**. An animal with an excellent disposition is friendly towards people. If you are cheerful, you're often said to have a sunny disposition.
- Story: 我来试着解释一下这三个词：disposition（性情）、character（性格）和personality（人格）。character是一个人的inner moral values（内在道德观念），而personality是在许多人的情况下，其中一个人所表现出来的与其他人之间的区别和特征，而disposition是属于character当中的那些natural qualities（天性的部分），而character本身会随着人在社会生活中打磨变得越来越好或越来越坏。因此，最内在的就是disposition；中间的是character，它是在disposition基础之上发展起来的，它还是属于个人层面的东西；而最外层的是personality，它是在character基础之上衍生的，它具有的社会性（人与人之间的关系），它是为了区分人与人之间的差别。
