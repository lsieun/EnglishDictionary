### 委婉的说

这一组的核心是stretch，它表示something that is difficult to achieve; the fact that something has gone past its usual limits

"It's a stretch" is an expression used to describe an unlikely achievement.

- It’s a stretch to think that 考虑（某种事情）是很不现实。这种用法是that+clause
- It's a stretch of the imagination to believe that. 这种用法是加to do

## 新想法

Right now it strikes me that，我自己就有过这种场景“忽然一个想法浮现在脑海之中”

- Right now it strikes me that it is a mission by no means easy to complete. 此时此刻我突然间想到这是个绝非容易完成的任务。
