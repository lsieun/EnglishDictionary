“外科”一词的英文名surgery，来自拉丁文Chirurgia，由希腊文cheri（手）和ergon（工作）组合而成。当时的外科强调通过动手（换药，手术和手法）来治疗伤病，以区别通过药物治疗疾病的内科。

Technically, in the US, a surgeon is a type of physician. All medical students, regardless of specialty(专业), become physicians as soon as they graduate from medical school.

However, I assume you are asking for the difference between a physician of a surgical specialty (“surgeon”), and one of a medical specialty (“physician”).

For many years, medicine has been divided into **surgical specialties** and **medical specialties**. Surgical specialists traditionally spend time doing procedures (e.g. in an operating room), and medical specialists traditionally spend time seeing patients in their office or hospital room to treat them with medications. However, in practice, this line is increasingly becoming blurred as there are a lot of medical specialists doing procedures (e.g. cardiologists, radiologists, gastroenterologists), and surgical specialists crossing over into medical diseases (e.g. endocrine surgeons, metabolic surgeons, etc.).
