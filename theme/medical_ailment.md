- post-holiday syndrome: 节后综合症；假后综合症；假期后症候群 A person may suffer from **post vacation blues** after returning home or to a normal routine from a long vacation, especially if it was a pleasurable one. The longer a trip lasts, the more intense the post vacation blues may be. This is because after the person returns home, they realize how boring and unsatisfactory their normal lifestyle routine is when compared to the activities they did while on their holiday/vacation. It is easier to overcome/adjust to a normal routine the shorter the trip was. Post vacation blues may result in tiredness, loss of appetite, strong feelings of nostalgia(怀旧；念旧 a feeling of sadness mixed with pleasure and affection when you think of happy times in the past), and in some cases, depression.
