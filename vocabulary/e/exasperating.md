# exasperating

- Word: exasperating
- Story: **Something that's exasperating is frustrating or irritating**.(我的理解，frustrating是没有达到你的期望，你又无可奈何，而irritating也是没有达到你的期望，然后把你激怒了，两者产生的情感不同) Your exasperating roommate might talk loudly on the phone late into the night and then wake up early to make his breakfast and leave your sink full of dirty dishes. 它就表示让你感到“厌烦”的状态
- Story: Traffic jams(交通拥挤) can be exasperating, especially if you're late for an important meeting, and chattering（喋喋不休地说） airplane seat mates are especially exasperating on very long flights. Things that make you annoyed are exasperating, and the word stems from the Latin exasperare, "irritate, provoke, or make rough," from the roots ex-, "thoroughly," and asper, "rough."
