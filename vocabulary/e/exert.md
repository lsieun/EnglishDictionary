# exert

- Word: exert
- Story: **Exert basically means to put forth effort to do something**. For example, when you exert yourself in a workout, you can really feel the burn in your muscles.
- Story: The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which is the source of our word — means to "put forth." That's where exert gets its meaning of physical force（这是具体的力量） — consider that when you try hard at something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But exert can refer to other ways you "push": you **exert your influence** to convince others to think your way; when one nation **exerts its power** on another; and gravity **exerts its force** on us, holding us down on earth. 这是抽象的力量
