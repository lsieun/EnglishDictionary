# extol

- Word: extol
- Story: If you have a crush(迷恋) on a guy who likes your best friend, it can be very depressing to listen to him extol your friend's virtues, while you just nod and smile. **If you extol something, you praise it very highly**.
- Story: The Bible says: "Now I, Nebuchadnezzar(尼布甲尼撒王), praise and extol and honor the King of heaven..." Nebuchadnezzar II was king of the second Babylonian(巴比伦) Empire, the one who sent the Jews(犹太人) into exile(流放；放逐；流亡). In some translations of the Bible, the word honor is replaced with glorify. Praise, extol, honor, glorify all mean about the same. The Bible often uses five words when one would be enough.
