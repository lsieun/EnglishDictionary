# endeavor

- Word: endeavor
- Story: When you endeavor to do something, you try hard to make it happen. A determined student might endeavor to get straight As on her report card.
- Story: "The ordinary objects of human endeavor — property, outward success, luxury — have always seemed to me contemptible," wrote Albert Einstein. Presumably, NASA had loftier objects in mind when they named one of their space shuttles Endeavour, using the British spelling. The word comes from the Old French phrase mettre en deveir, or "put in duty." As a verb, it's a more impressive word than try and suggests you're doing your darnedest(=most amazing or extraordinary) to make something happen.
