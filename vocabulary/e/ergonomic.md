An ergonomic design is one that offers a worker comfort while using it. It can be considered important for everything from an office chair to a keyboard, as Designer Yves Behar commented that "Ergonomics is about design that treats the body well." The word appeared in 1950, when the study of efficiency in the workplace became a science (even if your lumpy desk chair tells you otherwise).
