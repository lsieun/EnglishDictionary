- Story: First used in modern psychology around 1918（这个词相对来说，还是很新的）, the adjective extroverted has origins in the German word extra, meaning "outward," and the Latin word vertere, meaning "to turn." So extroverted people look outward rather than toward their inner thoughts. They're outgoing, expressive, and interested in what's going on around them. If you're extroverted, you probably enjoy parties and can move through the room with ease chatting with everyone whether you know them or not.
