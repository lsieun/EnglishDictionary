# edifice

- Word: edifice
- Story: Edifice means a building, but it doesn't mean just any building(edifice是一个建筑，但并非所有的建筑都称得上是edifice). To merit being called an edifice, a building must be important. A mini temple can be an edifice, or a towering sky scraper(摩天大楼).
- Story: The meaning of edifice has expanded to include a system of ideas––when it is complicated enough to be considered to have walls and a roof, then it is an edifice. You could say that basic facts of addition and subtraction are the foundation on which the edifice of higher math rests.
