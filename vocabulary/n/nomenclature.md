# nomenclature

- Word: nomenclature
- Story: When adjusting to a new job, you may have trouble understanding the nomenclature, or system of naming things, in the workplace. Just remember: they’re “guests,” not “customers," and they push a “purchase buggy,” not a “shopping cart.”
- Story: The "nomen-" in nomenclature comes from the Latin word for name. Nomenclature is a system for giving names to things within a particular profession or field. For instance, you may have heard of binomial(双名的) nomenclature in biology class. It refers to the way of referring to living things by two names, like calling humans Homo sapiens. Biologists all follow the same nomenclature so that they are easily understood by each other.
