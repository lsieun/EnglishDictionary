- Eg.: Let's say for a moment that you are a lumberjack. You have the best axe in the forest, which makes you the most productive lumberjack in the camp. Then one day, someone shows up and extols the virtues of a new tree-cutting paradigm, the chainsaw. The sales guy is persuasive, so you buy a chainsaw, but you don't know how it works. You try hefting it and swinging at the tree with great force, which is how your other tree-cutting paradigm works. You quickly conclude that this newfangled chainsaw thing is just a fad, and you go back to chopping down trees with your axe.
