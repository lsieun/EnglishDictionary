# nauseous

- Word: nauseous
- Story: Nauseous comes from the Latin word nausea, which means "seasickness." That's certainly one reason for getting nauseous, but we don't limit this word to the seafaring world anymore. Not only do we use this adjective when we're feeling queasy, but we also use it to describe whatever is making us feel queasy. A smell that turns your stomach is a nauseous smell. We also use nauseous figuratively when we're "grossed out" by someone who's overly romantic or self-involved.

- Type: adjective
- Meaning: feeling as if you want to vomit
- Chinese: 恶心的；想呕吐的
- Tags: 
- Eg.: Roller coasters(过山车) make me feel nauseous.
