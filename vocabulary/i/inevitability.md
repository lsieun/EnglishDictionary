- Story: Inevitability is related to the Latin word evitare, meaning “avoid.” When you add on the prefix in-, meaning “not,” and the noun suffix -ity at the end, you come up with something that has the quality of being unavoidable. Inevitability is most often used to describe unavoidable grim things — like “the inevitability of disaster” or “the inevitability of war,” but it can also be used for more light-hearted purposes as well. Think about the inevitability of happy endings in most fairy tales.
