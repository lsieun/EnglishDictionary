- Story: An intermediary is someone who acts as a go-between or a mediator between two other people. Be careful when you're the intermediary between two friends who are fighting, because they might both end up mad at you!
- Story: The word intermediary comes from the Latin intermedius, which is also the root word for intermediate. Inter- means between, and medius means the middle — intermediary retains that sense of being in the middle. Intermediaries are used to negotiate between two countries who are at odds, between a company and a client over a contract, between two bickering children, or between a boss and an employee in salary negotiations.
- Story: inter + media + ry。其实，media，就是媒体，就是媒介，是起中间桥梁的作用。社会上的媒体，就是一个中间载体，它把其它地方发生的事情告诉你。
