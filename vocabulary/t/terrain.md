- Story: In times of war, you'll often hear the term "hostile terrain"(不利的地形) used to describe a region with lots of mountains, vast stretches of desert, or impenetrable jungles(丛林). These are all areas of difficult terrain that are hard to pass. Much of humankind's history can be traced by its effort to alter the terrain. We've made mountains into meadows(草地；牧场), rivers into lakes, and prairies(大草原；牧场) into roads, all to make the terrain more livable for us. You could even go so far as to say that a person's psyche(心灵；心态) is mysterious terrain.
