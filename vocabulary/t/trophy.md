# trophy

- Word: trophy
- Story: **A trophy is a prize given for winning a competition**. Often made of metal (or plastic meant to look like metal), a trophy may not have much monetary value, but the pride it gives the person who receives it can be priceless. 可能这个奖品本身并不值钱，但它代表的荣誉是无价的
- Story: Trophy comes from the Greek word tropē, meaning "a turning, defeat of the enemy."（过去，讲词的来源） It later came to mean "**a monument of victory**," which it still celebrates today.（现在，记住“胜利”的物件） Think of the overjoyed(非常高兴) actor who holds his Oscar — a trophy — in the air during his acceptance speech（举例一，获奖）, or a team of eight year old soccer players who, in their group photo, hold their trophies in one hand while raising the index finger(食指) of their other hand, meaning "We're number one!"（举例二，获胜）
