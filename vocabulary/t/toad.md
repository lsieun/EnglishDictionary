# toad

- Word: toad
- Cognate: 
- Similar: 
- Story: A toad is an amphibian with dry, bumpy skin and no tail. A common myth says that toads will give you warts, but it's not true.
- Story: Toads are actually a type of frog. They tend to be short and wide, and to have larger eyeballs than typical frogs. Toads also don't jump as high as other frogs, and they don't need to live near water. The typically bumpy skin of toads is what led them to be associated with warts, and this perceived homeliness has made toad a derogatory term: "You're nothing but a horrible old toad!"
