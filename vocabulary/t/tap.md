# tap

- Word: tap
- Story: To tap is to lightly hit something, the way you tap your friend on the shoulder to get her attention or tap your foot against the floor when you're listening to music.
- Story: Your fingers tap the keyboard when you write an essay, and if you take tap dancing lessons, you'll spend time tapping your toes in tap shoes. Another kind of tap is a spigot that liquid or gas flows from, or the secret listening device a spy might use. As a verb, it can also mean "make use of," the way you tap into your sister's jar of change when you need an extra dollar or two.
