- Story: A male sheep or goat is called a ram(公羊). If you're a fan of reading your horoscope(占星术), you might notice that Aries(白羊座), usually considered the first sign of the zodiac（黄道十二宫图，用于占星术）, is represented by a ram.
- Story: Another kind of ram(夯锤；撞击装置) is a "battering ram," a tool for forcing a heavy door open or breaking a hole in a wall. This kind of ram comes from the male sheep and his powerful horns — and so does the verb ram: "I watched the rams ram their heads into each other as they battled over territory." Some word experts think the word stems from the Old Norse rammr, "strong."
