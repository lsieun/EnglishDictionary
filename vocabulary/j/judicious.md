# judicious

- Word: judicious
- Story: If you're judicious, you've got a good head on your shoulders and make good decisions.
- Story: As its sound implies, judicious comes from the same Latin word from which we get judge and judiciary(司法部), and not surprisingly a judicious decision is one that only comes after all sides have been weighed up and opposing points of view taken into consideration. Judicious decisions are never split-second(一瞬间作出的) decisions.

- Type: adjective
- Meaning: careful and sensible; showing good judgement
- Chinese: 审慎而明智的；明断的；有见地的
- Tags: 
- Eg.: He made a judicious decision to save money for his old age. 他做了个明智的决定，要为他的晚年攒钱。
