# jealousy

- Word: jealousy
- Story: Jealousy is that unpleasant emotion you feel when you think someone’s trying to take what’s yours. Jealousy might creep up on you if someone flirts with your sweetie or copies your unique style.
- Story: Jealousy is called the "green-eyed monster" because it can make people obsessed with how they compare to others, always trying to beat their rivals by calling attention to what they have and seeing if the rivals have any reaction. Don't confuse jealousy with envy, which can sometimes be a slightly more positive emotion. If you envy your friend's athleticism(健壮), you wish you had it too, but you also admire her dedication.
- Story: It’s no fun to feel envy or jealousy because both make you feel inadequate. Envy is when you want what someone else has, but jealousy is when you’re worried someone’s trying to take what you have. If you want your neighbor’s new convertible(敞篷车), you feel envy. If she takes your husband for a ride, you feel jealousy.
