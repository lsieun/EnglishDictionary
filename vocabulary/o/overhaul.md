# overhaul

- Word: overhaul
- Story: To overhaul is to completely renovate, making major changes in order to repair.
- Story: Back in the 1620s when the word was coined, overhaul described examining a fishing net to make sure there were no tears(撕裂) or big holes that would keep the fisherman from getting a big haul(用力拉), or large amount of fish. Today, an overhaul is usually the result of such a close examination — like the overhaul that some people want to make to American public schools, or the overhaul an old car needs to keep it on the road.
