# opaque

- Word: opaque
- Story: Use the adjective opaque either for something that doesn't allow light to pass through (like a heavy curtain) or for something difficult to understand (like bureaucratic gobbledygook).
- Story: Opaque is from a Latin word meaning "dark," and that was its original sense in English, but it now means literally "not transparent" or metaphorically "hard to understand; unclear": "Some of his sentences are really opaque." It used to be spelled "opake", which made the pronunciation clearer, but we then borrowed the more "opaque" French spelling. Come to think of it, English spelling is often pretty opaque, which makes it hard for learners of the language to master.

- Type: adjective
- Meaning: not clear enough to see through or allow light through
- Chinese: 不透明的；不透光的；浑浊的
