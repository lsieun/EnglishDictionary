# omnipresent

- Word: omnipresent
- Story: Omnipresent describes something that's everywhere at once, like a deity(神). If your parents are constantly monitoring what you do, you may feel like they're omnipresent —and look forward to going to college somewhere far, far away.
- Story: You might recognize the prefix "omni-", meaning "all," from words like omnipotent ("all-powerful") or omniscient ("all-knowing"). Add it to "present", and you have a word for something that's present all the time. You can't hide from an omnipresent being, and you can't escape an omnipresent smell. Language purists might prefer that a bad smell be described as ubiquitous ("turning up everywhere") and save the word omnipresent for the divine.
