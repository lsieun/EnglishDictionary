# outlandish

- Word: outlandish
- Story: If something is outlandish it's bizarre or unfamiliar, far outside the boundaries of expected or normal behavior. Driving around the city in a golf cart(高尔夫球车) and eating spaghetti with pineapple sauce are both examples of outlandish behavior.
- Story: It's easy to imagine how the word outlandish originated. The Old English root is utland, which literally means "out-land," or foreign. Now, it would be inappropriate to refer to a foreigner as outlandish, unless, say, he shows up to the office in a red patent-leather(漆革；漆皮) Speedo(紧身男式游泳裤) and a ten-gallon hat（高顶宽边的传统牛仔帽）.
