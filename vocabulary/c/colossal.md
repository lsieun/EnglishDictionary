# colossal

- Word: colossal

- Story: Colossal can refer to an item's physical size, like a giant redwood(红杉木) tree, but it can also be used to describe the force or scope of something — like the colossal force of a thunderstorm that knocked down the redwood tree, or the colossal scope of your school project on the history of the redwoods that seems like it will never, ever end. It comes from the Greek word kolossos, meaning "gigantic statue."
