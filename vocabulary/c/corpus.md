# corpus

- Word: corpus
- Cognate: Corpus sounds a little like corpse, and that's no coincidence; corpus means "body" in Latin, and though it's come to mean specifically "body of work," the two words are closely related.
- Story: **A corpus is a collection of writings**. If you tend to never throw anything away, you might have your entire school corpus, from your first scribbled(拙劣文字) words to your high school English essays.
- Story: The written works of an author, or from one specific time period, can be called a corpus if they're gathered together into a collection or talked about as a group. You could discuss the corpus of Dr. Seuss(苏斯博士，儿童文学家、教育学家), for example.
