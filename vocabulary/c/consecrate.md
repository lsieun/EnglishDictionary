# consecrate

- Word: consecrate
- Cognate: sacred
- Story: Consecrate means to make holy or to dedicate to a higher purpose. You need to consecrate a building to turn it into a church.
- Story: The "secr" part of consecrate comes from the Latin sacer "sacred." Remember that something consecrated is dedicated to God and thus sacred. And then remember that the meanings of words tend to stretch; over time this one moved from "dedicated to God" to "dedicated to whatever": jelly donuts, the perfect tan, finding a solution to Rubik's Cube(魔方).

## verb

- Meaning: to state officially in a religious ceremony that sth is holy and can be used for religious purposes
- Chinese: 祝圣；圣化；奉献（这些翻译，太过抽象，一点也不好。本质上是这样的：一个人私自的做什么事情，是不被别人认可的，只在正式的仪式上，经过神的鉴证，才算是被认可了。）
