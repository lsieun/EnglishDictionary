# cognitive

- Word: cognitive
- Cognate: cogn
- Story: If it's related to thinking, it's considered cognitive. Anxious parents might defend using flashcards(一种用来记录单词,数字等的小卡片,帮助记忆的辅助教学工具) with toddlers(学步的儿童；刚学会走路的孩子) as "nurturing their cognitive development."
- Story: The adjective, **cognitive**, comes from the Latin cognoscere "to get to know" and refers to **the ability of the brain to think and reason** as opposed to feel. A child's cognitive development is the growth in his or her ability to think and solve problems. Many English words that involve knowing and knowledge have `cogn-` in them such as cognizant(=having knowledge of something) "aware of" and **recognize** "to know someone in the present because you knew them from the past."
