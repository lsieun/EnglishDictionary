# cursory

- Word: cursory
- Story: No reason to get excited — cursory has nothing to do with bad language(bad language，表示“脏话；冒犯人的话”。我想，它之所以这么说，可能因为cursory与诅咒“curse”相近的原因). Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give your new haircut a cursory glance.
- Story: Cursory dates to the early 17th century, from the French word cursoire meaning "rapid," which comes from the Latin word cursorius, meaning "hasty, of a race or running." Something that is cursory is done quickly. A teacher might take a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions.
