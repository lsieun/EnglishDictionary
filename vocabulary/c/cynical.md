# cynical

- Word: cynical
- Story: If you think public officials are nothing but a bunch of greedy buffoons, you have a cynical attitude about politics.
- Story: A cynical person has a bleak(不乐观的；无望的) outlook(观点；见解) about others, always imagining that people are ruled by their worst instincts. H.L. Mencken was famous for saying cynical things like, "Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public." The original Cynics were ancient Greek philosophers who never had a good word to say about anyone. The Greek word kynikos actually means "canine," maybe because all of that sneering seemed a little dog-like.
