- Story: A lodge can also be a cabin in the woods; like an inn, it’s usually a temporary accommodation. But if you join your local lodge, you’ll be expected to be a regular visitor, at least at the monthly meetings. Lodge is also a verb, meaning to stay temporarily, or to give someone a place to stay. If you lodge a toothpick between your teeth, though, you’ll probably hope it won’t stay there too long.
