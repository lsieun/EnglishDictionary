# bizarre

- Word: bizarre
- Story: Someone or something bizarre is odd or unusual in appearance, style, or character. If your teacher walks into class wearing a purple boa(围巾), lime-green cowboy boots, and a scuba mask, you might comment, "How bizarre!"
- Story: Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected elements. Bizarre was borrowed from French, from bizarro "angry, fierce, strange," from Spanish, "bold, like a knight." The Spanish word was probably influenced by Basque bizar "a beard," since beards were taken as signs of energy and spirit. Nowadays it takes more than a beard to get you labeled as bizarre. **Unpredictable behavior is often called bizarre** — like when your little brother decides that he will communicate only in Pig Latin.
