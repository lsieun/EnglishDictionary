# hygiene

- Word: hygiene
- Story: **Hygiene is any practice or activity that you do to keep things healthy and clean**. Washing hands, coughing(咳嗽) into your elbow(肘部), and regular house cleaning are all part of good hygiene.
- Story: Hygieia was the Greek goddess of health, cleanliness and sanitation(卫生设备；卫生设施体系), so it's not hard to see where the word hygiene comes from. Good oral(口腔的) hygiene includes brushing and flossing(用牙线剔) your teeth, and working in a clean kitchen helps promote food hygiene. You have a better chance of staying healthy during flu season -and any other time- if you practice good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently.
