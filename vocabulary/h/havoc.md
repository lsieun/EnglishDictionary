# havoc

- Word: havoc
- Story: Havoc is a noun that means devastation(巨大的破坏) or total mayhem(骚乱；慌乱). Havoc often wreaked(造成) by hurricanes, angry mobs(暴民), plundering(掠夺；抢掠) Vikings(维京人，北欧海盗), and wild parties(野外狂欢) that get out of control.
- Story: If we trace havoc way back, we arrive at a crossroads. Some people believe that the word comes from the Old French havot, meaning “plundering, devastation,” while others argue that it was passed down to us from the Latin habere, meaning “to have, possess.” Either way you look at it, the meaning remains the same: widespread disorder or destruction.
