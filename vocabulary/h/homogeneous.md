# homogeneous

- Word: homogeneous
- Story: The adjective homogeneous comes from the Greek homogenes, meaning “of the same kind.” You can break down the root of the word further into two parts: homos, meaning “same,” and genos, meaning “kind, gender, race, stock.” It sounds very scientific, but if you look around the table at home and everyone is eating a bowl of oatmeal(燕麦片), you could safely describe your family’s breakfast tastes as homogeneous.
