# horde

- Word: horde
- Cognate: 
- Similar: 
- Story: Use the word horde to describe a large crowd: “A horde of people followed the pop star as he left the airport in Helsinki.”
- Story: The noun horde is not for the sedate — the word typically is used to describe a group that is in motion, maybe even a little unruly, such as a horde of fans pursuing a film star or a horde of ants invading a picnic. If you are describing a calm, orderly gathering, the word group or crowd may be a better choice. You can save horde for the next time you need to describe, for example, your experience at a pre-Christmas sale (“A horde of holiday shoppers rushed toward the last discounted television set”).
