# heterogeneous

- Word: heterogeneous
- Story: The adjective heterogenous is a somewhat comparative word, suggesting that two or more things are unlike in substance or nature, as in a heterogenous mixture containing two substances that do not totally combine, like oil and water.
- Story: We can see the roots of heterogenous in the Greek combination of heteros, meaning "other," and genos, meaning "a kind." So heterogenous means "other kind." The United States, as a melting pot of cultures, contains a heterogenous population. Note that while this spelling is acceptable, the word is more correctly spelled heterogeneous, with the ending adding an "e" before the ous.

- Type: adjective
- Meaning: consisting of many different kinds of people or things
- Chinese: 由很多种类组成的；各种各样的
