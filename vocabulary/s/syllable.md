# syllable

- Word: syllable
- Story: A syllable can be made up of just a vowel — "a" can be a syllable — or a vowel and one or more consonants(辅音) — "skip" is one syllable, but three sounds, or phonemes: sk-i-p.
- Story: **When you're figuring out how many syllables a word has, you have to listen to how it's pronounced, not look at the spelling**.(判断一个词里有多少个音节，不是看它怎么拼写，而是看它怎么发音) Household is two syllables — which you'll hear when you say the word — even though it's got four vowels. Elephant is three syllables, and hippopotamus is five. You can also use syllable for the tiniest bits of language: "I loved every syllable of your speech," or "Please don't repeat a syllable of what I told you."

- Type: noun [C]
- Meaning: any of the units into which a word is divided, containing a vowel sound and usually one or more consonants
