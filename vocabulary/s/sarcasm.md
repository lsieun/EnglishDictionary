# sarcasm

- Word: sarcasm
- Story: Irony employed in the service of mocking or attacking someone is sarcasm. Saying "Oh, you're soooo clever!" with sarcasm means the target is really just a dunderhead(傻瓜；笨蛋).
- Story: Sarcasm is sometimes used as merely a synonym of irony, but the word has a more specific sense: irony that's meant to mock or convey contempt. This meaning is found in its etymology(词源学). In Greek, sarkazein meant "to tear flesh; to wound." When you use sarcasm, you really tear into them. A clever person coined the variant spelling sarchasm (a blend of sarcasm and chasm) and defined it as "the gap between the author of sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it."
- Story: 我觉得，irony和sarcasm这两个词的区别是这样的，irony包含好和坏两种意思，好的时候，表示通过说反话来让人开心大笑，坏的时候，表示说反话来表达自己的讽刺、瞧不起；而sarcasm则完完全全是一个“坏”的词，它就是为通过说反话来让别人不开心。
