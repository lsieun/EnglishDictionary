# spectacle

- Word: spectacle
- Story: A spectacle is something you can't believe you are seeing. Get on top of your desk at work in your underpants(内裤) while playing the kazoo(小笛) and you're making a spectacle of yourself.
- Story: The word spectacle comes from the Latin spectaculum meaning "public show," an apt translation because a spectacle, like a public show, is something worth watching. A ballet is a spectacle, or an elaborate production worth watching. Often the word is used to describe something that has a particularly exciting visual element to it — like an acrobatic(杂技的) display or a magic trick. It's something you have to see to really appreciate.
- Story: 关于spectacular和spectacle之间的区别，spectacular是指一种“一群人通过准备、有明确目的的活动”，而spectacle可能是大自然的景象，也可能是一种人们生活中“非刻意”的场景。
