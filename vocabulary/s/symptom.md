# symptom

- Word: symptom
- Cognate: 
- Story: A symptom is the result or byproduct of something else—specifically, the result we use to prove that that other thing exists. Simple example: a cough is a symptom of a cold. We know we have a cold because we have the symptom, a cough.
- Story: Don't confuse the symptom with the cause. Even when the symptom is worse than the cause, don't be tempted to confuse them. Fever, sneezing, achiness: all of these are symptom of a cold. But they are not the cold. They are symptoms of it. Relationship experts argue over whether "cheating” is the cause of unhappiness or the symptom. In other words, do people think about breaking up because of cheating, or do they cheat because they're thinking about breaking up.
