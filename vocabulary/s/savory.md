# savory

- Word: savory
- Story: Something savory is full of flavor, delicious and tasty — usually something that someone has cooked. In the world of cuisine(烹饪), savory is also often used to mean the opposite of sweet, or salty.
- Story: The easiest way to remember savory is that it rhymes with flavory — which is not a real word, but should be. Interestingly, the word unsavory — which is clearly the opposite of savory — is almost never used to describe food. If some a dish doesn't taste good, it, well, isn't good-tasting. If something is unsavory(令人讨厌的；令人恶心的), then it's probably a person or situation that seems morally questionable. So, save savory for delicious food and save unsavory for things, people and ideas deserving of the adjective.

## adjective
