- Story: The adjective solemn comes from the Latin sollemnis, which means formal or ceremonial. You can still use it to describe a ceremony or event, but it's also a good word for talking about someone who's serious and sincere and maybe lacks a sense of humor about certain things. Here's a trick for remembering it: Think of a "sole man," a serious guy standing alone at a party talking to no one.
