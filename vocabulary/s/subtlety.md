# subtlety

- Word: subtlety
- Story: The Latin root of subtle and subtlety originally meant "finely woven"(梭织物) and was used to describe fabric(面料；织品). The subtlety of an argument is in the fine weave of the words and thoughts that it is made up of. When translating, you often lose the subtleties of the original language, the interlacing of word, idea and connotation(隐含意义). When you're trying to persuade your parents of something, subtlety might get you further than outright(完全的；彻底的) demands.

## noun

- Meaning: the small but important details or aspects of sth
- Chinese: 细小但重要的地方；微妙之处（我觉得这个词有趣，因为它表达了一种状态，即两种事物之间的差异，虽然很小，但却很重要）
