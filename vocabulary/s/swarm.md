# swarm

- Word: swarm
- Story: A swarm is a good word for a large group of bees going on the attack — not good news. Like bees, any group of people or animals can be considered a swarm if they act together and quickly — even fiercely.
- Story: On a hot day, when an ice-cream truck shows up, it's usually greeted by a swarm of hot, hungry kids. People at a concert can be a swarm — and people in the swarm can be hurt, because there's lots of pushing and shoving. When tickets for a popular movie go on sale, a swarm of people will swarm(蜂拥；一大批向同方向移动) the theater. As you can see, swarm works as either a noun or verb, and people could teach bees a thing or two about swarming.
