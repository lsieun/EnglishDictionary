# disheveled

- Word: disheveled
- Story: The meaning of disheveled hasn't changed much from the 16th and 17th centuries, when it referred to disordered clothing or hair.
- Story: People or things that are disheveled are kind of a mess. Wrinkled clothes, knotted hair, and a chaotic house might earn the adjective disheveled. There are a lot of synonyms for disheveled, including "disordered," "sloppy," and "cluttered." A person can look disheveled when getting up in the morning, and some people even adopt a disheveled look on purpose, trying to appear casual about grooming(给自己梳理毛发) and dressing while working hard to achieve just the right unwashed and mussed-up style.
