# distraught

- Word: distraught
- Story: If you are upset, you are distraught. If you don't want to explain why you are pulling your hair out, just utter "Leave me alone; I'm distraught." It'll work.
- Story: While distraught may sound like an old Germanic past participle, it is actually an alteration of distract from the Latin distrahere "to draw in different directions." If you are distraught, you are so upset that it's hard to think straight, hence your mind is "drawn in different directions." 这个解释的比较好，描述人的一种状态，“思绪拉向不同的方向，无法向某个方向思考”
