# yolk

- Word: yolk
- Story: A yolk is the inner, yellow part of an egg. If you order eggs "sunny side up," those "suns" are the egg yolks.
- Story: When a bird lays an egg that's fertilized and begins to grow into a baby bird, the yolk is the substance that nourishes the bird embryo(胚胎). The eggs we eat have yolks too, but since they are unfertilized, these protein-rich yolks can be beaten into omelettes or mixed into cake batter. The Old English root of yolk, geolca, literally means "the yellow part."
