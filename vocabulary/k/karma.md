# karma

- Word: karma
- Story: The Hindu and Buddhist concept karma is **what will happen to you in your next life based on what you do in this life. Performing kind acts in this life gives you good karma for your next life.**
- Story: To understand karma, it’s important to understand that in Hinduism and Buddhism, practitioners believe in reincarnation. Reincarnation is the idea that after you die, you are reborn into a new body and a new life. How good or bad that new life is depends on the karma you’ve accumulated in your previous lives. By this line of thinking, performing good acts in this life means that in your next life you might be born the princess of a tropical paradise.
