# mystery

- Word: mystery
- Story: A mystery is something that baffles(使困惑) our understanding and cannot be explained. The giant slabs of Stonehenge(巨石阵), remain a mystery to this day.
- Story: The noun **mystery** comes from the Greek mysterion, meaning "secret rite or doctrine." A great synonym for secret is **enigma**. We use this word all the time to describe stuff we don't understand, from **crop circles**(麦田圆圈) and UFOs to **the origins of the universe** and **the workings of the human brain**. In literature, drama, and film, a mystery is a story that centers around a crime, usually murder, which finally gets solved at the very end.
