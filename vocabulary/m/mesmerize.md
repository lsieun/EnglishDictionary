# mesmerize

- Word: mesmerize
- Story: You meet someone and you can’t take your eyes off them, like you are connected by an invisible cord(细绳) and can’t break free. Those kinds of people have the power to mesmerize, holding your attention like you’re under hypnosis.
- Story: The word mesmerize comes from the last name of 18th century German physician Franz Mesmer, who believed that all people and objects are pulled together by a strong magnetic force, later called mesmerism(难以抗拒的魅力). If you ever start to feel mesmerized, maybe it’s because you find someone fascinating, or maybe you’ve been hypnotized by a magician. Hard to tell from here.
