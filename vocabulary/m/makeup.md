# makeup

- Word: makeup
- Story: Your makeup(组成) is the sum of what makes you who you are, or the sum of what you smear(涂抹) on your face! You could say that your makeup is a combination of your parents' genes. Or, you could wear cosmetic(化妆品) makeup to accentuate those physical traits.
- Story: Your makeup(性格) is every personality characteristic that, combined, form a unique person — but the makeup(彩妆) you put on your face can be used to disguise your real self a little bit. This kind of makeup is also called cosmetics, and it consists of things like lipstick(口红；唇膏；唇彩), mascara(睫毛膏), foundation(粉底), and so on. This meaning of makeup has been in use since the 1880s, a period when Queen Victoria declared it vulgar(庸俗的), only appropriate for stage actors.
