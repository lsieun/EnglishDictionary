# plethora

- Word: plethora
- Story: Plethora means an abundance or excess of something. If you have 15 different people who want to take you on a date, you have a plethora of romantic possibilities.
- Story: Plethora comes from the Greek for "fullness." Although it was originally used only in old-fashioned medicine to describe the condition of having too much blood, we use it to talk about any excessive supply.

The stress is on the first syllable: PLETH-uh-ruh.
