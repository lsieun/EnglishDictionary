# profound

- Word: profound
- Story: **When you need a word that's deeper than "deep," consider profound**. A philosopher is likely to make many profound pronouncements.
- Story: Profundus literally means "deep" in Latin, and profound had the same meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it also meant "**figuratively deep**" — that is, very great or intense: "The new laws have had a profound impact." Of people, it means "**very knowledgeable or insightful**," but sometimes when a person tries to sound profound, they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed up with big words.
