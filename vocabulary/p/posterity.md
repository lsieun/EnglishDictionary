# posterity

- Story: Posterity is a noun meaning "future generations." These people of the future could be your children and great-great grandchildren, or any people who are born after you.
- Story: If you save something "for posterity," you're hoping that years later people will appreciate it, like a time capsule you bury in the yard.
