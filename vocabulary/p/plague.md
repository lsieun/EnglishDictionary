# plague

- Word: plague
- Story: Centuries ago, if you had admitted to a friend that you had the plague(瘟疫), that friend would have hightailed(迅速撤退) it in the other direction. In the Middle Ages, the plague was a horribly contagious illness that spread like wildfire through Europe, killing millions of people. Thanks to the introduction of better hygiene(卫生) and antibiotics(抗菌素), plague doesn't describe a killer disease as often these days. Instead, it commonly overstates an annoyance, like an apartment dweller claiming his building is plagued by cockroaches(蟑螂).
