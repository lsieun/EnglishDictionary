# precept

- Word: precept
- Similar: perception
- Story: A precept is a rule or direction, often with some religious basis, dictating a way you should act or behave.
- Story: Precepts are little life lessons that are usually passed down to children by authority figures such as parents, teachers, or religious figures. They are not as simple or practical as "eat your vegetables"; they tend to be more weighty and pretentious.
- Story: -cept- 印象当中，是表示“拿”；但我觉得，它是一种“意识”，例如concept = con + cept，是多个人都拥有的意识，称之为“概念”，而precept = pre + cept 是 “在做任何事情之前，要遵守的道德规则、行为规范”

## noun
