# ambiguous

- Word: ambiguous
- Story: The `ambi-` prefix means "both ways," while the `guous` part is from the Latin verb agere, "to lead or drive." Thus an ambiguous sentence or situation drives us in two different directions at once. The accent is on the second syllable, "big," which you can remember since something that's ambiguous can lead to big misunderstandings.

- Type: adjective
- Meaning: that can be understood in more than one way; having different meanings
- Chinese: 模棱两可的；含混不清的；多义的
