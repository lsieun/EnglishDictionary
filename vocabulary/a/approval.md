# approval

- Word: approval
- Story: **Approval is a formal agreement**. It's probably not a good idea to mail the invitations for your beach party until you've gotten official approval for the enormous bonfire(篝火；营火) you're planning to light.
- Story: Building designs, budgets, grant applications — these all require **official approval** before they can be put into effect. You can also use the word approval to talk about **less formal permission**, like a teacher's approval of your plan to buy pizza for the whole class. **Approval also means the belief that something is good**, like your approval of your neighbor's purple house. Until 1800, it was much more common for people to use the word approvance to mean the same thing.
