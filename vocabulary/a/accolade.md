# accolade

- Word: accolade
- Story: A knight being honored with the tap of a sword-blade was the earliest form of accolade. Today, an accolade is more than a way to bestow knighthood, **it is a form of praise or an award**.
- Story: In the early 17th century, the French accoler meant to "embrace the neck," which was done as part of a knighthood ceremony. By the 19th century, accolade came to mean "award." **A person who achieves a goal in research or service may receive an official paper certificate or trophy(奖杯), an accolade of achievement**, while **a performer or speaker might get an accolade in the form of applause from the audience**. Rarely does either of these types of accolade involve a sword.
