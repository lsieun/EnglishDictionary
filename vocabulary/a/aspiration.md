# aspiration

- Word: aspiration
- Cognate: 
- Story: If your aspiration, or ambition, is to climb Mt. Everest峰(埃佛勒斯, 喜马拉雅山主峰之一,又名圣母峰,亦作Chomolungma) someday, you better start training, because it’s a long, hard climb that requires a lot of preparation.
- Story: Aspiration means "inhalation" or "breathing." So how did it come to mean "ambition" or "the will to succeed"? The Latin gives us a clue: spirare ("to breathe") and spiritus ("spirit"). It was once believed that our breath was our soul or spirit, which might explain why we talk about "breathing life into"(为某事物注入生命) something, or coming up with energy and ideas to invigorate it. How else to breathe life into something than with ambition and drive, in other words, "spirit"?
