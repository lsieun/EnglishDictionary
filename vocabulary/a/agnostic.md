# agnostic

- Word: agnostic
- Story: If someone believes they cannot know whether or not God exists, label them an agnostic. A bad joke: Did you hear about the dyslexic(诵读困难者) agnostic insomniac(失眠者)? He stayed up all night wondering if there was a dog.
- Story: In 1869, English biologist T.H. Huxley coined this noun referring to someone whose religious beliefs lie somewhere in between those of a theist(有神论者) and an atheist(无神论者) — that is, a believer and a disbeliever in God. Huxley combined the Greek prefix a-, meaning "not," with gnostos, "known." It can be used as a noun or adjective, and it can also refer to uncertainty about questions other than the existence of God: "Some philosophers remain agnostic as to whether people have free will."
