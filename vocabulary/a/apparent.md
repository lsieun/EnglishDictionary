# apparent

- Word: apparent
- Cognate: appear
- Story: Apparent means obvious, but — and this is confusing — it can also mean something that seems to be true but isn't definite. "The train's arrival is apparent — it's in the station — but apparently my friend missed it because she is not getting off."
- Story: It makes sense that apparent has the same ancient root as appear because it's about what is plain to see. Its subtle power of suggestion, however, is wonderfully useful. The "heir apparent"(确定接班者) technically means next in line, but the ink isn't dry. The power of apparent is that it leaves the door open for a little ambiguity. Maybe the heir apparent will be the next king, or maybe he'll be overthrown in a bloodless coup(政变) by his apparently more ambitious cousin.
- Story: 这个词有趣的地方在于它的“微妙之处”，它表示“表面上是这个样子，但也可能有一些不确定的因素”
