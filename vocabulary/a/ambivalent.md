# ambivalent

- Word: ambivalent
- Story: If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself ambivalent about it.
- Story: Ambivalent means "having mixed feelings about something." A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word Ambivalenz in the early twentieth century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix `ambi-`, meaning "both," with valentia, "strength." So etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things — but in practice, ambivalence(对同一人、物、事的矛盾心理，如又爱又憎) often arises from caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless tofu.
