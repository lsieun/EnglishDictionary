# arbitrary

- Word: arbitrary
- Story: Something that's arbitrary seems like it's chosen at random instead of following a consistent rule. Team members would dislike their coach using a totally arbitrary method to pick starting players.
- Story: Even though arbitrary comes from a word meaning "judge" (arbiter), that doesn't mean judges are always fair. Calling a decision-maker arbitrary is usually a negative thing, suggesting the person is making rules based on whim rather than justice. A coach who selects starting players arbitrarily isn't strictly applying a rule; he could just be picking names out of a hat.

## adjective

- Meaning: not seeming to be based on a reason, system or plan and sometimes seeming unfair; based on chance rather than being planned or based on reason
- Chinese: 任意的；武断的；随心所欲的（中文的翻译的并不准确，它不是基于reason或plan，而是on whim）
