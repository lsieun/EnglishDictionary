# unleash

- Word: unleash
- Story: When you remove your dog's leash so she can run wildly across the beach, you unleash her — you set her loose. And when you unleash(发泄) a storm of insults against your brother, you allow them to flow freely from your lips.
- Story: There are two ways to use the verb unleash. Literally, it means "set loose," like when a police officer unleashes her trained dog to sniff luggage(行李) for illegal drugs, or a farmer unleashes her llama(羊驼) after moving it into a pen(围栏；畜栏). Figuratively, you can unleash all kinds of emotions, forces, opinions, and actions. Unhappy citizens might unleash a series of high-profile(引人注目的) protests, or a barrage(拦河坝；水坝) of shouted demands, for example.
