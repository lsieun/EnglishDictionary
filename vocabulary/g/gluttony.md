# gluttony

- Word: gluttony
- Story: Called one of the seven deadly sins, **gluttony is characterized by a limitless appetite for food and drink** and overindulgence(放纵) to the point where one is no longer **eating just to live, but rather living to eat**.
- Story: Present in Old French and Middle English, the word glutonie derived from the Latin gluttire, "**to swallow**," which in turn came from gula, the word for "throat." In some cultures, gluttony is considered an indication of the country’s wealth,(暴饮暴食，在某些情况下，代表了一个国家的财富多少) but in most cases it is simply gross(令人不快的) and unacceptable. Nowadays, gluttony is seen as an emotional cry for help,(当代的视角，暴饮暴食，是反应感情方面有所求助) as succinctly(简明的；言简意赅的) put by author Peter De Vries, who said, “Gluttony is an emotional escape, a sign something is eating us.”
