- Story: A grievance is a complaint. It can be formal, as when an employee files（提起诉讼） a grievance because of unsafe working conditions, or more of an emotional matter, like a grievance against an old friend who betrayed you.

Often a grievance is a complaint about something that breaks a rule or a law, like a grievance filed against a person who builds a fence in his front yard in a town that does not allow that.
