# wilderness

- Word: wilderness
- Cognate: 
- Story: If you don’t mow your lawn all summer, don’t be surprised if your neighbors complain that it resembles a wilderness, a wild area that is not tended by humans.
- Story: The wilderness is of course filled with many animals, but did you know that the name of an animal is hidden in the word wilderness? The word actually is a combination of "wild" plus the Old English word "dēor"(鹿), along with the ending "-ness", used in nouns that refer to a certain condition. While dēor eventually turned into our modern word deer, it didn’t refer to the antlered(带角的) Bambi we imagine. It was simply the word for “animal.”
