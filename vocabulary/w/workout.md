# workout

- Word: workout
- Story: A workout is an exercise session. If you hope to join your school's track team(田径队), you'd better be prepared for regular workouts.
- Story: If you do yoga, lift weights, or run with your dog, you can call each of these activities a workout. When it's a verb, workout becomes two separate words: work out. So you can either say "I work out three days a week" or "I usually do three workouts a week." When this noun first appeared around the turn of the 20th century, it referred specifically to a practice boxing match.
