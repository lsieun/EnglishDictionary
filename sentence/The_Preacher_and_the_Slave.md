# The Preacher and the Slave

## Lyrics

### Verse #1:

- Long-haired preachers come out every night              
- Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right
- But when asked how 'bout something to eat 
- They will answer in voices so sweet

Chorus Type #1:

- You will eat, bye and bye
- In that glorious land above the sky 
- Work and pray, live on hay 
- You'll get pie in the sky when you die

bye and bye = by and by (不久以后 after a short time)

### Verse #2:

- And the Starvation Army, they play 
- And they sing and they clap and they pray 
- Till they get all your coin on the drum 
- Then they tell you when you're on the bum

Chorus Type #1

### Verse #3:

- Holy Rollers and Jumpers come out 
- And they holler(叫喊), they jump and they shout 
- Give your money to Jesus, they say    
- He will cure all diseases today

Chorus Type #1

### Verse #4:

- If you fight hard for children and wife
- Try to get something good in this life 
- You're a sinner and bad man, they tell 
- When you die you will sure go to hell.

 Chorus Type #1

### Verse #5:

- Workingmen of all countries, unite 
- Side by side we for freedom will fight 
- When the world and its wealth we have gained 
- To the grafters we'll sing this refrain(副歌)

Chorus Type #2: 

- You will eat, bye and bye 
- When you've learned how to cook and how to fry 
- Chop some wood, 'twill do you good 
- Then you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye
