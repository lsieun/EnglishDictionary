## Itachi Uchiha

(To Naruto when they had their last encounter)
"You don't become the Hokage to be acknowledged by everyone. The one who is acknowledged by everyone becomes the Hokage."

(To Naruto when they had their last encounter)
"However strong you become, never seek to bear everything alone. If you do, failure is certain."

(To Naruto when they had their last encounter)
"Even the strongest of opponents always has a weakness."

(To Kisame when they have their first encounter)
“We aren't fish, we are human. No matter who you are, you do not know what kind of human you are until the very end. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are. That’s the view of death, don’t you think?”

(To Kisame when they have their first encounter)
"It is not wise to judge others based on your own preconceptions and by their appearances."

(To Orochimaru when he tried to steal Itachi's body)
"Any technique is worthless before my eyes."

(To Sasuke while Itachi was leaving Konoha)
"My foolish brother… If you want to kill me… curse me! Hate me! And live a long and unsightly life… Run away… run away… and cling to your pitiful life. And then some day, when you have the same eyes as I do, come before me."

(To Sasuke during their fight)
"People Live their Lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That is how they define "Reality" . But what does it mean to be "correct" or "true"? They are merely vague concepts... Their "Reality" may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to be simply living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?"

(To Kabuto during their fight)
"He who forgives and acknowledges himself... that is what it truly means to be strong!"

(To Kabuto during their fight)
"The ones who aren't able to acknowledge their own selves are bound to fail."

(To Kabuto during their fight)
"If you want to know who you are, you have to look at your real self and acknowledge what you see"

(To Sasuke when they were fighting Kabuto)
"The village does have its dark side and its inconsistencies, but I'm still Konoha's Itachi Uchiha."

(To Sasuke when Itachi was moments before his death)
“Sorry, Sasuke… There won’t be a next time.”

(His last words To Sasuke when Itachi was released from reincarnation)
"I failed. I won't put myself above you and tell you this and that, it's too late. So this time for once, let me tell you one small truth. It's all right if you never forgive me, but no matter what you become, I will always love you."

Itachi is the most inspiring character in Naruto (probably the whole anime). He was the man who sought peace behind darkness. His words and actions show us how he is in a different dimension from others. This is my list of the best quotes of Uchiha Itachi. Do point out any quotes I have missed.
